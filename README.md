# Life-Expectancy-Analysis

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nailasrivastava/life-expectancy-analysis

This project is still in progress, but here is some things that I've already done:

1. LED.ipynb - python file where missing values ​​were replaced
   1.1. Cleaned_Life_Expectancy.csv - data without N/A
2. LE.twb - Tableau workbook with 2 interactive dashboards. Thanks to this dashboard I figured out, that replacing of N/A wasn't enough and now I am wotking on 'cleaning of anomalies' file, that will be published in future
   2.2. Link to online dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/roman.larkin/viz/LE_17562775085450/Dashboard2?publish=yes
